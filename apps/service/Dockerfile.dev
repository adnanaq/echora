# Development Dockerfile using Pants-built PEX binary
# This Dockerfile is managed by Pants and should be built with: pants package apps/service:service-dev

FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install development dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    curl \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the self-contained PEX binary built by Pants
# For dev, we use the same PEX as production but can mount source for live reload
COPY apps.service/service.pex /app/service.pex

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV ENVIRONMENT=development

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8002

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8002/health || exit 1

# For development with live reload, you can:
# 1. Use volume mounts: docker run -v $(pwd):/app/src ...
# 2. Rebuild PEX when dependencies change: pants package apps/service:service

# Run the PEX binary
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/service.pex"]
