# Development Dockerfile using Pants-built PEX binary
# This Dockerfile is managed by Pants and should be built with: pants package apps/vector_service:vector-service-dev

FROM python:3.12-slim

# Install runtime dependencies (curl for healthcheck)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \

# Copy the self-contained PEX binary built by Pants
COPY apps.vector_service/vector_service.pex /app/vector_service.pex

# Run as non-root user for security (catches permission issues early)

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \

# Development workflow:
# PEX files are self-contained archives - volume mounts won't override the code inside.
# To see code changes:
#   1. Rebuild the PEX: pants package apps/vector_service:vector_service
#   2. Rebuild the image: docker compose build service
#   3. Restart the container: docker compose up -d service
# For faster iteration, consider running the service directly: uv run python -m src.main

# Run the PEX binary
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/vector_service.pex"]
